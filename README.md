QuickCourseEval
===============

To aid in filling Course Evaluation forms at IIT Bombay'

As you know, the deadline for filling out the course evaluation is approaching. To aid you in this, here is a small firefox addon that will save you a lot of clicks.

The usage scenario is this: You are filling out the course eval form for a prof, and most of the options you want to fill are the same (say Strongly Agree). But you still have to go and manually click the answer for each of the questions. Not any more. With QCE, you can set all the options in the course evaluation form to the same value with a single click. 

Here are the installation and running instructions:
1. Download the xpi file.
2. Open firefox -> Hit Ctrl+O (open) ->  Browse to the file -> Double Click -> Install
3. Follow onscreen instructions, and restart firefox if it asks you to. The addon is now installed 
4. Now open firefox again, go to asc.iitb.ac.in and login
5. In the menu on the left, go to Academics -> Course Evaluation -> Online Course Evaluation
6. Now right click on the frame on the right, and select This Frame -> Show Only this frame (Had issues with handling frames, hence this step)
7. Now select a course and instructor, hit view evaluation form, and you are ready to go
8. On the course evaluation form page, see the addon bar at the bottom, and click on the 'Quick Course Eval' button
9. See the magic

A request: Please don't use this addon to avoid filling the course evaluation, or to fill false information. The purpose of the addon is to help you fill out the form. The power is in your hands. Use it wisely.
